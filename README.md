# Welcome to my first project with React!

This project it's meant to help little stores to have a full control of he customers they have, the money they spend and the points they generate.

## Branches

ðŸ¥‡ Api. In here you can try the full project with a dummy database in a headless CMS (directus). You can try with your own account if you have it!

ðŸ¥ˆ dummyInput. In case you don't have a backend, here you can try the app with a dummy array with around 30 users to test and play.

## Next steps:
  - Deploy the app.
  - Improve the UX with CSS.

More to come!
